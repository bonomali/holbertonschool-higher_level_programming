## Description

During this project I will learn:
- What is OOP
- “first-class everything”
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is self
- What is a method
- What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python

## Requirements for Python scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)’`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)’`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)’` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)’`)
