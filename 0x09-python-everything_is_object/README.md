# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects
---
## Description

During this project I will learn:
- What is an object
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- What are the builtin mutable types
- What are the builtin immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions


## Requirements for Python scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.6)
- All files must be executable
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)’`)
- All classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)’`)
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)’` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)’`)

0-answer.txt | What function would you use to print the type of an object?
1-rectangle.py | A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with attribute `width` (with setter and getter), and attribute `height`(with setter and getter), and optional instantiation of `width` and `height`
2-rectangle.py | A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with the previous attributes and also methods `area` and `perimeter` that returns the area and perimeter of the rectangle
4-rectangle.py | A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with the previous attributes and also with error checking on `perimeter`
5-rectangle.py | A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with the previous attributes and also deletes an instance of the rectangle with a printed message
6-rectangle.py | A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with the previous attributes and also with public class attribute `number_of_instances`
7-rectangle.py | A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with the previous attributes and also public class attribute `print_symbol`
8-rectangle.py | A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with the previous attributes and also static method `bigger_or_equal` that returns the biggest rectangle based on the area
9-rectangle.py | A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with the previous attributes and also class method square that returns a new rectangle with width==height==size
